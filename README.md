# Crunch Time

## Description

Crunch Time takes in the experience based on stress & procrastination and is transformed into an interactive game. The game involves an Alarm Clock modified with an Arduino to interact with the Electron game app interface, including a blanket & pillow to set in the premise of the game. Crunch Time is an interactive, action-paced survival puzzle game that has the player remember the 4-coded pin for the alarm clock. The player must rest on their "bed" to start the round to wait for the time it alarms. Once it alarms, you have to enter the 4 inputs to get the right pattern within a certain amount of time. If the player successfully enters the code within the duration, it loops back as it increases in difficulty. IF the player lost, the game interface shows the results of the game with the number of rounds the player has gone through and the best time recorded as well.
